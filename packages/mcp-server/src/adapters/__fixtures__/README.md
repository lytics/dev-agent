# Adapter Test Fixtures

Simple, scannable test files for InspectAdapter tests.

## Files

- `modern-typescript.ts` - Clean TypeScript with full type annotations
- `legacy-javascript.js` - CommonJS with throw-based error handling
- `react-component.tsx` - React component with TypeScript
- `mixed-patterns.ts` - Intentionally mixed patterns (ESM + CJS, partial types)
- `go-service.go` - Go code with error returns

These fixtures are kept simple so they can be parsed by the scanner without external dependencies.
