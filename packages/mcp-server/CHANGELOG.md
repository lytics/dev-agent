  - @lytics/dev-agent-subagents@0.3.1

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- ad4af12: ### Features

  - **Test file hints in search results**: `dev_search` now shows related test files (e.g., `utils.test.ts`) after search results. This surfaces test files without polluting semantic search rankings.

  ### Design

  - Uses structural matching (`.test.ts`, `.spec.ts` patterns) rather than semantic search
  - Keeps semantic search pure - test hints are in a separate "Related test files:" section
  - Patterns are configurable for future extensibility via function parameters

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 40192f5: Fix dev_history tool schema for Claude API compatibility

  - Removed `anyOf` from input schema (Claude API doesn't support it at top level)
  - Validation for "at least one of query or file required" is still enforced in execute()

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b55a04: Fix MCP server to include all 9 adapters and improve tool descriptions for better AI tool adoption

  **Bug Fix:**

  - CLI's `mcp start` command now registers all 9 adapters (was missing HealthAdapter, RefsAdapter, MapAdapter, HistoryAdapter)
  - Updated tool list in CLI output and install messages to show all 9 tools

  **Tool Description Improvements:**

  - `dev_search`: Added "USE THIS FIRST" trigger, comparison to grep for conceptual queries
  - `dev_map`: Clarified it shows component counts and exports, better than list_dir
  - `dev_explore`: Clarified workflow - use after dev_search for "similar" and "relationships" actions
  - `dev_refs`: Added guidance to use for specific symbols, use dev_search for conceptual queries
  - `dev_history`: Added "WHY" trigger, clarified semantic search over commits
  - `dev_plan`: Emphasized "ALL context in one call" value prop for GitHub issues
  - `dev_gh`: Clarified semantic search by meaning, not just keywords

  These description improvements help AI tools (Claude, Cursor) choose the right dev-agent tool for each task.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c42f5ba: feat: Intelligent Git History (v0.4.0)

  New capabilities for understanding codebase history:

  **`dev_history` tool** - Semantic search over git commits

  - Search commit messages by meaning (e.g., "authentication token fix")
  - Get file history with rename tracking
  - Token-budgeted output

  **`dev_map` enhancements** - Change frequency indicators

  - 🔥 Hot directories (5+ commits in 30 days)
  - ✏️ Active directories (1-4 commits in 30 days)
  - 📝 Recent activity (commits in 90 days)

  **`dev_plan` enhancements** - Git context in planning

  - Related commits shown alongside code snippets
  - Issue/PR references extracted from commits
  - Helps understand prior work on similar features

  **Core infrastructure:**

  - `GitIndexer` for semantic commit search
  - `LocalGitExtractor` for git operations
  - Extensible architecture for future git features

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c42f5ba]
  - @lytics/dev-agent-core@0.4.0
  - @lytics/dev-agent-subagents@0.3.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- afa8adb: feat: Context Quality release (v0.3.0)

  This release significantly enhances dev-agent's ability to provide rich, actionable context to AI assistants.

  ## New Tools

  ### `dev_refs` - Relationship Queries

  Query code relationships to understand what calls what:

  - Find all callers of a function
  - Find all callees (what a function calls)
  - Includes file paths, line numbers, and snippets

  ### `dev_map` - Codebase Overview

  Get a high-level view of repository structure:

  - Directory tree with component counts
  - **Hot Paths**: Most referenced files in the codebase
  - **Smart Depth**: Adaptive expansion based on information density
  - **Signatures**: Function/class signatures in export listings
  - Configurable depth and focus directory

  ## Enhanced Tools

  ### `dev_plan` - Context Assembler (Breaking Change)

  Completely refactored from heuristic task breakdown to context assembly:

  - Returns rich context package instead of task lists
  - Includes issue details with comments
  - Includes relevant code snippets from semantic search
  - Includes detected codebase patterns
  - Let LLMs do the reasoning with better data

  **Migration:** The old task breakdown output is removed. The new output provides strictly more information for LLMs to create their own plans.

  ### `dev_search` - Richer Results (from v0.2.0)

  - Code snippets included in results
  - Import statements for context
  - Caller/callee hints
  - Progressive disclosure based on token budget

  ## Philosophy

  This release embraces the principle: **Provide structured data, let LLMs reason.**

  Instead of trying to be smart with heuristics, dev-agent now focuses on assembling comprehensive context that AI assistants can use effectively.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [afa8adb]
  - @lytics/dev-agent-core@0.3.0
  - @lytics/dev-agent-subagents@0.2.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ce7390b: feat: Richer search results with code snippets, imports, and token budget management

  **Core Scanner:**

  - Extract code snippets during indexing (truncated to 50 lines)
  - Parse and store import statements using ts-morph
  - Extended DocumentMetadata with `snippet` and `imports` fields

  **MCP Formatters:**

  - CompactFormatter and VerboseFormatter now render snippets and imports
  - Progressive disclosure: full → signature → minimal detail levels
  - Token budget management (500-10000 tokens, configurable per-search)
  - Improved token estimation for code-heavy text

  **Search Adapter:**

  - New `tokenBudget` parameter for dev_search tool
  - Enables snippets and imports by default

  The `dev_search` tool now returns actionable context instead of just pointers, making it significantly more useful for AI assistants to understand code without additional file reads.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [ce7390b]
  - @lytics/dev-agent-core@0.2.0
  - @lytics/dev-agent-subagents@0.1.1
