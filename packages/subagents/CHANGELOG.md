- Updated dependencies [d0481b4]
  - @lytics/dev-agent-core@0.5.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c42f5ba: feat: Intelligent Git History (v0.4.0)

  New capabilities for understanding codebase history:

  **`dev_history` tool** - Semantic search over git commits

  - Search commit messages by meaning (e.g., "authentication token fix")
  - Get file history with rename tracking
  - Token-budgeted output

  **`dev_map` enhancements** - Change frequency indicators

  - 🔥 Hot directories (5+ commits in 30 days)
  - ✏️ Active directories (1-4 commits in 30 days)
  - 📝 Recent activity (commits in 90 days)

  **`dev_plan` enhancements** - Git context in planning

  - Related commits shown alongside code snippets
  - Issue/PR references extracted from commits
  - Helps understand prior work on similar features

  **Core infrastructure:**

  - `GitIndexer` for semantic commit search
  - `LocalGitExtractor` for git operations
  - Extensible architecture for future git features

### Patch Changes

  - @lytics/dev-agent-core@0.4.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- afa8adb: feat: Context Quality release (v0.3.0)

  This release significantly enhances dev-agent's ability to provide rich, actionable context to AI assistants.

  ## New Tools

  ### `dev_refs` - Relationship Queries

  Query code relationships to understand what calls what:

  - Find all callers of a function
  - Find all callees (what a function calls)
  - Includes file paths, line numbers, and snippets

  ### `dev_map` - Codebase Overview

  Get a high-level view of repository structure:

  - Directory tree with component counts
  - **Hot Paths**: Most referenced files in the codebase
  - **Smart Depth**: Adaptive expansion based on information density
  - **Signatures**: Function/class signatures in export listings
  - Configurable depth and focus directory

  ## Enhanced Tools

  ### `dev_plan` - Context Assembler (Breaking Change)

  Completely refactored from heuristic task breakdown to context assembly:

  - Returns rich context package instead of task lists
  - Includes issue details with comments
  - Includes relevant code snippets from semantic search
  - Includes detected codebase patterns
  - Let LLMs do the reasoning with better data

  **Migration:** The old task breakdown output is removed. The new output provides strictly more information for LLMs to create their own plans.

  ### `dev_search` - Richer Results (from v0.2.0)

  - Code snippets included in results
  - Import statements for context
  - Caller/callee hints
  - Progressive disclosure based on token budget

  ## Philosophy

  This release embraces the principle: **Provide structured data, let LLMs reason.**

  Instead of trying to be smart with heuristics, dev-agent now focuses on assembling comprehensive context that AI assistants can use effectively.
