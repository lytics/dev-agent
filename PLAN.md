# Dev-Agent Roadmap

> **Mission:** Be the best context provider for AI coding tools. Don't compete with LLMs—empower them.

Dev-agent provides semantic code search, codebase intelligence, and GitHub integration through MCP (Model Context Protocol). The LLM does the reasoning; we provide the context.

---

## Philosophy

**What we are:**
- Best-in-class code indexing (fast, accurate, multi-language)
- Relationship intelligence (call graphs, dependencies, imports)
- Structured data provider (let LLMs synthesize)
- Token-efficient context (progressive disclosure)
- Local-first (no API keys, no cloud dependency)

**What we are NOT:**
- An AI coding assistant (that's Claude/Cursor's job)
- A natural language summarizer (LLMs do this better)
- A task planner (provide context, let LLMs plan)

---

## Completed: Intelligent Git History (v0.4.0) ✅

> "Who changed what and why" - completing the context picture.

**Epic:** #90

### Philosophy

Git history is valuable context that LLMs can't easily access. We add intelligence:
- **Semantic search** over commit messages (can't do with `git log --grep`)
- **Change frequency** insights (which code is "hot"?)
- **Auto-inclusion** in planning context

### Tasks

| Task | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Git types and extractor infrastructure | #91 | ✅ Done |
| Commit indexing in core | #92 | ✅ Done |
| `dev_history` MCP adapter | #93 | ✅ Done |
| Change frequency in `dev_map` | #94 | ✅ Done |
| History integration in `dev_plan` | #95 | ✅ Done |

### Architecture

- `GitExtractor` interface (pluggable for future GitHub API)
- `GitCommit` type with PR/issue refs (for future linking)
- Blame methods stubbed (for future `dev_blame`)
- Cross-repo `repository` field in types

---

## Current: Quality & Thoroughness (v0.4.x)

> Addressing gaps identified in benchmark study comparing dev-agent vs baseline Claude Code.

**Context:** Benchmarks showed dev-agent provides 44% cost savings and 19% faster responses, but with quality trade-offs. These improvements close the gap.

### Benchmark-Driven Improvements

| Task | Gap Identified | Priority | Status |
|------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Diagnostic command suggestions | Baseline provided shell commands for debugging; dev-agent didn't | 🔴 High | 🔲 Todo |
| Test file inclusion hints | Baseline read test files; dev-agent skipped them | 🔴 High | ✅ Done |
| Code example extraction | Baseline included more code snippets in responses | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |
| Exhaustive mode for debugging | Option for thorough exploration vs fast satisficing | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |
| Related files suggestions | "You might also want to check: X, Y, Z" | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |

### Test File Hints - Design (v0.4.4)

**Problem:** Benchmark showed baseline Claude read test files, but dev-agent didn't surface them.

**Root cause:** Test files have *structural* relationship (same name), not *semantic* relationship:
- Searching "authentication middleware" finds `auth/middleware.ts` (semantic match ✓)
- `auth/middleware.test.ts` might NOT appear because test semantics differ
- "describe('AuthMiddleware', () => {...})" doesn't semantically match the query

**Design decision:** Keep semantic search pure. Add "Related files:" section using filesystem lookup.

| Approach | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Filename matching | ✅ Chosen | Fast, reliable, honest about what it is |
| Boost test queries | ❌ Rejected | Might return unrelated tests |
| Index-time metadata | ❌ Rejected | Requires re-index, complex |

**Phased rollout:**

| Phase | Tool | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 (v0.4.4) | `dev_search` | ✅ Done |
| 2 | `dev_refs`, `dev_explore` | 🔲 Todo |
| 3 | `dev_map`, `dev_status` | 🔲 Todo |

**Implementation (Phase 1):**
- After search results, check filesystem for test siblings
- Patterns: `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `__tests__/*.ts`
- Add "Related files:" section to output
- No change to semantic search scoring

### Tool Description Refinements (Done in v0.4.2)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Improved dev_search description ("USE THIS FIRST") | ✅ Done |
| Improved dev_map description (vs list_dir) | ✅ Done |
| Improved dev_explore description (workflow hints) | ✅ Done |
| Improved dev_refs description (specific symbols) | ✅ Done |
| All 9 adapters registered in CLI | ✅ Done |

## Next: Extended Git Intelligence (v0.5.0)

> Building on git history with deeper insights.

### Git Tasks

| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `dev_blame` - line attribution | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |
| PR/issue linking from commits | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |
| Contributor expertise mapping | 🟢 Low | 🔲 Todo |
| Cross-repo history | 🟢 Low | 🔲 Todo |

### Tool Improvements

| Task | Rationale | Priority | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Generalize `dev_plan` → `dev_context` | Currently requires GitHub issue; should work with any task description | 🔴 High | 🔲 Todo |
| Freeform context assembly | `dev_context "Add rate limiting"` without needing issue # | 🔴 High | 🔲 Todo |
| Multiple input modes | `--issue 42`, `--file src/auth.ts`, or freeform query | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |

**Why:** `dev_plan` is really a context assembler but is tightly coupled to GitHub issues. Generalizing it:
- Works without GitHub
- Easier to benchmark (no real issues needed)
- Name matches function (assembles context, doesn't "plan")
- More useful for ad-hoc implementation tasks

### Benchmark Improvements

| Task | Rationale | Priority | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Add implementation task types | Current benchmark only tests exploration; missing `dev_plan`/`dev_gh` coverage | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |
| Generic implementation patterns | "Add a new adapter similar to X" — tests pattern discovery | 🟡 Medium | 🔲 Todo |
| Snapshotted issue tests | Capture real issues for reproducible `dev_plan` testing | 🟢 Low | 🔲 Todo |

| TypeScript/JavaScript | ✅ Done | - |
| Markdown | ✅ Done | - |
| Python | 🔲 Planned | 🟡 Medium |
| Go | 🔲 Planned | 🟢 Low |
| Rust | 🔲 Planned | 🟢 Low |

### Test Coverage Intelligence

| Feature | Priority |
|---------|----------|
| Map tests to source files | 🟢 Low |
| "What tests cover this code?" | 🟢 Low |
| Test file suggestions | 🟢 Low |

### IDE Integrations

| Integration | Status | Priority |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Cursor (via MCP) | ✅ Done | - |
| Claude Code (via MCP) | ✅ Done | - |
| VS Code extension | 🔲 Planned | 🟢 Low |

## Shelved / Reconsidered

These were in the original plan but have been deprioritized or reconsidered:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| LLM integration | Dev-agent provides context, not reasoning. LLM is external. |
| Effort estimation | Heuristics are unreliable. Let LLMs estimate with context. |
| PR description generation | LLM's job, not ours. Provide context instead. |
| Task breakdown logic | Generic tasks aren't useful. Return raw data. |
| Express API server | MCP is the interface. No need for REST API. |

---

## Technology Stack

### Current
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Runtime:** Node.js >= 22 (LTS)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm 8.15.4
- **Build:** Turborepo
- **Linting:** Biome
- **Testing:** Vitest (1379+ tests)
- **Vector Storage:** LanceDB (embedded, no server)
- **Embeddings:** @xenova/transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **AI Integration:** MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Code Analysis:** ts-morph (TypeScript Compiler API)

### Considered but Not Adopted
- ChromaDB → LanceDB (embedded is simpler)
- TensorFlow.js → @xenova/transformers (better models)
- Express → MCP (protocol is the interface)

## Success Metrics

How we know dev-agent is working:

1. **Search quality:** Relevant results in top 3
2. **Token efficiency:** Context fits in reasonable budget (<5k tokens)
3. **Response time:** Search <100ms, index <5min for 10k files
4. **Daily use:** We actually use it ourselves (dogfooding)
5. **LLM effectiveness:** Claude/Cursor make better suggestions with dev-agent

### Benchmark Results (v0.4.3)

#### By Task Type

| Task Type | Cost Savings | Time Savings | Why |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| **Debugging** | **42%** | 37% | Semantic search beats grep chains |
| **Exploration** | **44%** | 19% | Find code by meaning |
| **Implementation** | **29%** | 22% | Context bundling via `dev_plan` |
| **Simple lookup** | ~0% | ~0% | Both approaches are fast |

**Key insight:** Savings scale with task complexity.

#### Why It Saves Money

| What dev-agent does | Manual equivalent | Impact |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Returns code snippets in search | Read entire files | 99% fewer input tokens |
| `dev_plan` bundles issue + code + commits | 5-10 separate tool calls | 29% cost reduction |
| Semantic search finds relevant code | grep chains + filtering | 42% cost reduction |

#### Token Analysis (Debugging Task)

| Metric | Without dev-agent | With dev-agent | Difference |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Input tokens | 18,800 | 65 | **99.7% less** |
| Output tokens | 12,200 | 6,200 | **49% less** |
| Files read | 10 | 5 | **50% less** |

**Trade-offs identified:**
- Baseline provides more diagnostic shell commands
- Baseline reads more files (sometimes helpful for thoroughness)

**Target users:** Engineers working on complex exploration, debugging, or implementation tasks in large/unfamiliar codebases.
