name: Release

# This workflow runs after CI succeeds on the main branch.
# Uses Changesets for version management and automatic releases.
# 
# Features:
# - Creates version PRs automatically when changesets are merged
# - Publishes to npm with provenance (trusted publishing)
# - Creates GitHub releases automatically
# 
# Setup:
# 1. Set "private": false in package.json to enable publishing
# 2. Configure npm trusted publishing (no token needed with provenance)
# 3. Merge changeset files to trigger version PR
# 4. Merge version PR to publish and create GitHub release
