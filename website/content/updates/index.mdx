## v0.8.4 — Refocus on Semantic Value

*December 14, 2025*

**Removed git analytics commands to refocus on dev-agent's unique semantic capabilities.**

### What Changed

**🗑️ Removed Features**

Eliminated CLI commands that duplicate git/GitHub functionality:

- **`dev owners`** — Use `git log --format="%ae" <path> | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn` or GitHub Contributors
- **`dev activity`** — Use `git log --since="1 month" --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`

**Impact:** -1,006 lines removed, cleaner codebase focused on unique semantic value.

### Why This Matters

Dev-agent's **unique value** is semantic understanding:

- ✅ **Semantic code search** (`dev_search`) — Find code by meaning, not keywords
- ✅ **Semantic commit search** (`dev_history`) — Search git history by concept
- ✅ **Code structure analysis** (`dev_map`, `dev_explore`) — AST + embeddings
- ✅ **GitHub context** (`dev_plan`, `dev_gh`) — Cross-reference issues with code

Git analytics (ownership, activity) are better served by existing tools:
- Git CLI has excellent built-in analytics
- GitHub provides rich contributor visualizations
- No need to duplicate what already works

### What's Kept

**Core semantic tools remain:**
- `dev_search` — Semantic code search
- `dev_history` — Semantic commit search
- `dev_map` — Codebase structure with change frequency
- `dev_plan` — GitHub issue context assembly
- `dev_explore` — Code similarity and relationships
- `dev_gh` — GitHub semantic search

**Supporting infrastructure:**
- `code_metadata` table — Introspection of indexed code (LOC, functions, imports)
- `calculateChangeFrequency` — Powers `dev_map` change frequency display

### Migration Guide

For git analytics, use standard tools:

```bash
# Ownership by contributor
git log --format="%ae" packages/core/ | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Recent activity
git log --since="1 month" --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# GitHub visualization
# Visit: https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/graphs/contributors
```

### Philosophy

**Dev-agent is an MCP context provider, not a CLI analytics dashboard.**

Focus on what AI assistants can't get elsewhere:
- Semantic search over code and commits
- AST-powered code structure analysis
- Cross-referencing multiple data sources
- Contextual code understanding

Leverage existing tools for what they do best:
- Git for commit/author analytics
- GitHub for contributor visualization
- Dev-agent for semantic understanding

## v0.8.2 — Massive Indexing Performance & UX Improvements

*December 13, 2025*

**184% faster indexing with zero silent gaps and context-aware developer insights.**

### What's New

**⚡ Performance Improvements (184% Faster)**

Eliminated performance bottlenecks throughout the indexing pipeline:

- **63x faster metadata collection** — Single batched git command replaces 863 individual calls
- **Removed storage size calculation** — Deferred to on-demand in `dev stats` (saves 1-3s)
- **Simplified ownership tracking** — Author contributions calculated on-demand (1s vs pre-indexing overhead)
- **Total speedup** — Indexing completes in ~33s vs ~95s (61s improvement!)

**🎨 Section-Based Progress Display**

No more silent gaps during indexing. Clean, informative output inspired by Homebrew and Cargo:

```bash
dev index .

✓ Scanning Repository (3.2s)
  433 files → 2,525 components

✓ Embedding Vectors (20.7s)
  2,525 documents

✓ Git History (4.4s)
  252 commits

✓ GitHub Issues/PRs (7.8s)
  163 documents

✓ Repository indexed successfully!

  Indexed: 433 files • 2,525 components • 252 commits • 163 GitHub docs
  Duration: 33.5s

💡 Next steps:
   dev map       Explore codebase structure
```

**Applied to 4 commands:** `dev index`, `dev update`, `dev git index`, `dev github index`
- **Git root detection** — Works from any subdirectory

### Architecture Simplifications

This release removes unnecessary complexity while improving performance:

- **Removed `file_authors` SQLite table** — On-demand calculation is fast enough (1s)
- **Removed `appendFileAuthors()` and `getFileAuthors()` from MetricsStore**
- **Removed `authorContributions` from IndexUpdatedEvent**
- **Cleaner separation** — Metrics for analytics, ownership for developer insights

### UX Improvements

**More frequent progress updates:**
- Scanner logs every 2 batches or 10 seconds (was every 50 files)
- Debug logs for slow file processing (>5s)
- Maximum 1-second gaps between progress updates

**Better grouping in `dev owners`:**
- Groups by GitHub handle instead of email (merges multiple emails per developer)
- Monorepo-aware directory grouping (2 levels for `packages/`, `apps/`)

**Graceful degradation:**
- Verbose mode and non-TTY environments show traditional logs
- TTY detection for CI/CD compatibility

### Before & After

**Before:**
```
[14:27:37] typescript 3450/3730 (92%)
           ← 3 MINUTES OF SILENCE
[14:30:09] typescript 3600/3730 (97%)
           ← EMBEDDING COMPLETES
           ← 63 SECONDS OF SILENCE  
[14:31:12] Starting git extraction
```

**After:**
```
✓ Scanning Repository (3.2s)
  433 files → 2,525 components

✓ Embedding Vectors (20.7s)
  2,525 documents

✓ Git History (4.4s)
  252 commits
```

### Migration

No breaking changes for end users. Internal APIs changed:
- `IndexUpdatedEvent` no longer includes `authorContributions`
- `MetricsStore` ownership methods removed (use on-demand calculation)

No re-index required. Changes take effect immediately.

## v0.8.0 — Developer Insights & Performance

*December 13, 2025*

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice:** `dev owners` and `dev activity` were removed in v0.8.4. Use `git log` or GitHub for contributor analytics. Dev-agent now focuses on semantic search and code understanding.

**New developer activity and ownership commands with 35x faster queries via indexed author contributions.**

### What's New

**🗺️ New Command: `dev map`**

Visualize your codebase structure with component counts, exports, and hot paths:

```bash
dev map --depth 2 --change-frequency

packages/
├── 🔥 core/ (45 components, 12 exports) — 12 commits in 30d
│   ├── scanner/ (18 components, 3 exports)
│   └── vector/ (12 components, 5 exports)
├── ✏️ cli/ (28 components, 8 exports) — 3 commits in 30d
└── mcp-server/ (35 components, 9 exports)
```

**224x performance improvement** (103s → 0.46s) through optimized scanning and lazy embedder initialization.

**📊 Developer Insight Commands**

Two new top-level commands for understanding codebase activity:

```bash
# See most active files with commit counts and complexity
dev activity

# See developer specializations and file ownership
dev owners
```

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ dev owners

👥 Developer Contributions

  Developer                Files   Commits   Last Active
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  jane@example.com         147     523       2 hours ago
  john@example.com         89      312       1 day ago
  alice@example.com        64      201       3 days ago

Summary:
• 305 files analyzed across 3 developers
• Most active: jane@example.com (147 files)
• Average 3.5 commits per file
```

**💾 Persistent Metrics with SQLite**

New MetricsStore tracks code analytics over time:
- File-level metrics (lines, complexity, change frequency)
- Author contributions per file
- Historical snapshots for trend analysis
- Foundation for future analytics commands (`dev trends`, `dev health`)

**⚡ Performance Improvements**

Multiple commands received dramatic speedups:

- **`dev map`:** 224x faster (103s → 0.46s) via optimized scanning
- **`dev owners`:** 35x faster (17.5s → 0.5s) via indexed author data
- **`dev stats`:** 10x faster via direct JSON reads
- **Offline capability:** Indexed data works without git access

**🎨 CLI Enhancements**

- Modernized output with compact, scannable tables
- Factual summaries instead of verbose recommendations
- Visual indicators for activity (🔥 hot, ✏️ active, 📝 recent)
- GitHub handle resolution for developer identification
- Comprehensive help text with examples across all commands

**🏗️ Architecture & Quality**

This release includes significant internal improvements that improve reliability and enable future features:

- **Service layer architecture** — 7 services with dependency injection for better testability
- **Complete Zod validation** — All 9 MCP adapters validated at runtime
- **SearchService refactor** — Shared search logic across tools reduces duplication
- **Enhanced error handling** — Clearer messages and proper logging throughout
- **Batched git operations** — Reduced overhead from O(N files) to O(1)
- **1,918 tests passing** — Comprehensive test coverage for all new features

These improvements make dev-agent more stable, easier to extend, and ready for upcoming analytics features.

### Migration Notes

**Breaking Changes:**

- `dev metrics activity` → `dev activity` (top-level command)
- `dev metrics ownership` → `dev owners` (top-level command)
- `dev metrics size` removed (redundant with `dev stats`)

**What You Get:**

The `dev metrics` namespace is now reserved for future analytical commands like `trends`, `health`, and `complexity`. The simpler top-level commands provide better discoverability and UX.

### Re-index Required

To populate author contribution data, re-index your repository:

```bash
dev index .
```

This is a one-time operation. Future updates via `dev update` will maintain the author data automatically.

## v0.7.0 — UX & TypeScript Performance Improvements

*December 11, 2025*

**Enhanced user experience and configurable TypeScript performance optimizations.**

### What's New

**🎯 Improved User Experience**

- **Idempotent MCP install** — `dev mcp install` now shows positive messaging when server already exists instead of erroring
- **Seamless workflow** — `dev index` automatically uses sensible defaults when no config exists (no manual `dev init` required)

**⚡ TypeScript Performance Optimization**

New default exclusions provide **10-15% indexing performance improvement** for TypeScript projects:

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "excludePatterns": [
      // Standard exclusions
      "**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/.git/**", "**/coverage/**",
      // TypeScript performance exclusions (new!)
      "**/*.mock.ts", "**/*.mock.tsx", "**/mocks/**",
      "**/*.d.ts", "**/test-utils/**", "**/testing/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

**🛠️ Full Configurability**

- **Smart defaults** — New users get performance benefits automatically
- **Complete control** — Fully customizable via `.dev-agent/config.json`
- **Semantic value preserved** — Stories files kept (contain valuable component documentation)

### Customization Examples

**Include type definition files:**
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "excludePatterns": [
      "**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/.git/**", "**/coverage/**",
      "**/*.mock.ts", "**/*.mock.tsx", "**/mocks/**",
      "**/test-utils/**", "**/testing/**"
      // Removed "**/*.d.ts" to include type definitions in search
    ]
  }
}
```

**Add project-specific patterns:**
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "excludePatterns": [
      // Default patterns...
      "**/vendor/**", "**/*.generated.ts", "**/legacy/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Migration

No breaking changes. All improvements are backward compatible.

---

## v0.6.1 — Reliability & Performance Improvements

*December 11, 2025*

**Enhanced reliability, performance configuration, and better documentation for the Go support released in v0.6.0.**

### What's New

**⚡ Performance Configuration**

Fine-tune scanning and indexing performance with environment variables:

```bash
# High-performance systems (8GB+ RAM, 8+ cores)
export DEV_AGENT_TYPESCRIPT_CONCURRENCY=30
export DEV_AGENT_INDEXER_CONCURRENCY=8

# Memory-conservative systems (under 4GB RAM)
export DEV_AGENT_CONCURRENCY=5
export DEV_AGENT_INDEXER_CONCURRENCY=2

dev index .  # Uses your custom settings
```

**Auto-detection:** If no variables are set, dev-agent automatically detects optimal settings based on your CPU and memory.

**🛠️ Enhanced Reliability**

- **Runtime WASM validation** — Go scanner now validates tree-sitter WASM availability before parsing
- **Build script improvements** — Prevent silent failures that could break Go support
- **Better error handling** — Clearer error messages and proper logging levels across all scanners

**📚 Documentation Improvements**

- Document missing `dev update` command for fast incremental indexing
- Add timing expectations: initial indexing takes 5-10 minutes for large codebases (4k+ files)
- Enhanced troubleshooting guide with performance tuning recommendations
- New performance tuning section in configuration docs

**🧪 Testing & Architecture**

- 57 new tests covering utility functions and edge cases
- Dependency injection for testable file system operations
- Extracted reusable modules for WASM resolution, concurrency calculation, and file validation

### Migration

No breaking changes. All improvements are backward compatible.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Auto-Detected Default |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `DEV_AGENT_CONCURRENCY` | Global concurrency setting | Based on CPU/memory |
| `DEV_AGENT_TYPESCRIPT_CONCURRENCY` | TypeScript file processing | Based on system resources |
| `DEV_AGENT_INDEXER_CONCURRENCY` | Vector embedding batches | Based on available memory |
| `DEV_AGENT_GO_CONCURRENCY` | Go file processing | Based on system resources |

## v0.6.0 — Go Language Support

*December 10, 2025*

**Full Go language support with tree-sitter.** Index Go codebases with the same quality as TypeScript — functions, methods, structs, interfaces, and generics.

### What's New

**🐹 Go Scanner**

dev-agent now fully supports Go codebases:

```go
// All of these are now indexed and searchable:
func NewServer(cfg Config) *Server { ... }
func (s *Server) Start(ctx context.Context) error { ... }
type Config struct { Host string; Port int }
type Handler interface { Handle(ctx context.Context) error }
type Stack[T any] struct { items []T }  // Generics!
```

**Features:**
- Functions and methods with receiver information
- Structs, interfaces, and type aliases
- Go 1.18+ generics support
- Go doc comment extraction
- Exported symbol detection (capital letter convention)

**📋 Progress Logging**

New `--verbose` flag shows detailed progress:

```bash
dev index . --verbose
[scanner] Found 4338 go files {language: "go", files: 4338}
⠧ Embedding 4480/49151 documents (9%)
[indexer] Embedding complete {documentsIndexed: 49151}
```

**🚫 Smart Exclusions**

Generated files are automatically skipped:
- `*.pb.go` — Protobuf
- `*.gen.go`, `*_gen.go` — Code generators
- `*.pb.gw.go` — gRPC gateway
- `mock_*.go`, `mocks/` — Mock files
- `testdata/` — Test fixtures

### Why This Matters

Go teams can now use dev-agent for semantic code search across their entire codebase. Search for "authentication middleware" and find your Go handlers, not just TypeScript files.

**Tested on:** Large Go codebase (~4k files, 49k documents) ✅

### Technical Details

Go parsing uses **tree-sitter WASM** — the same parser used by GitHub, Neovim, and other tools. This provides:
- Fast, incremental parsing
- No Go installation required
- Portable across platforms
- Foundation for future Python/Rust support

---

## v0.5.2 — GitHub Indexing for Large Repositories

*December 6, 2025*

**Fixed `ENOBUFS` errors when indexing repositories with many GitHub issues/PRs.** Large active repositories can now be fully indexed without buffer overflow issues.

### What's Fixed

**🐛 Buffer Overflow Resolution**

The GitHub indexing phase would fail with `ENOBUFS` (No buffer space available) on repositories with extensive GitHub activity:

```bash
# This would fail before:
dev index
✖ Failed to index repository
[03:09:07] ERROR Failed to fetch issues: spawnSync /bin/sh ENOBUFS
```

**Solution:**
- Increased buffer capacity from 1MB to 50MB for GitHub API responses
- Reduced default fetch limit from 1000 to 500 items (per type)
- Added `--gh-limit` flag for custom limits

### What's New

**⚙️ Configurable Limits**

```bash
# Default (works for most repos)
dev index

# Large repos (200+ issues/PRs)
dev index --gh-limit 200

# Very active repos (500+ issues/PRs)  
dev index --gh-limit 100
```

**💬 Better Error Messages**

If buffer issues occur, you now get actionable guidance:
```
Failed to fetch issues: Output too large. 
Try using --gh-limit with a lower value (e.g., --gh-limit 100)
```

### Why This Matters

Many production repositories have hundreds or thousands of GitHub issues/PRs. Without this fix, `dev index` would fail completely on these repos, preventing AI tools from understanding project context.

Now it just works — and if you hit limits, the CLI tells you exactly how to fix it.

**Tested on:** 6,989 file repository with 1,000 GitHub issues/PRs ✅

---

## v0.5.1 — Incremental Indexing

*December 3, 2025*

**`dev update` now actually works.** Only re-index files that changed — no more waiting for full re-scans.

### What's New

**⚡ Fast Updates**

```bash
dev index .     # First run: full index
dev update      # Fast! Only processes changes
```

**🔍 Smart Change Detection**

- Detects modified files via content hash
- Finds new files added since last index
- Cleans up documents for deleted files
- Removes orphaned symbols when code changes

### Why This Matters

Before: Every `dev index .` re-scanned your entire codebase. On a 10k file repo, that's 5+ minutes.

Now: `dev update` detects what changed and only processes those files. Same result, fraction of the time.

---

## v0.5.0 — Modern JavaScript Support

*December 2, 2025*

**Better coverage for how developers actually write code today.**

Modern JavaScript and TypeScript codebases look very different from traditional OOP. React hooks, arrow functions, and configuration objects are the primary APIs — and dev-agent now understands them.

### What's New

**🎯 Arrow Functions**

```typescript
// Now indexed! AI can find these via semantic search
export const useAuth = () => { ... }
const validateEmail = (email: string) => email.includes('@')
```

**⚛️ React Hooks Detection**

Hooks are automatically detected by the `use*` naming pattern. When you search for "authentication hook", dev-agent knows `useAuth` is a hook — not just a function.

**📦 Exported Constants**

Configuration objects, context providers, and factory-created values are now searchable:

```typescript
export const API_CONFIG = { baseUrl: '/api', timeout: 5000 }
export const ThemeContext = createContext({ dark: false })
export const SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES = ['typescript', 'javascript']
```

### Why This Matters

Before v0.5.0, searching for "API configuration" wouldn't find `export const API_CONFIG = {...}`. Now it does. This means:

- **Better search results** for modern React/TypeScript codebases
- **More context** for AI assistants to understand your code
- **Fewer "I couldn't find..." moments** when asking about hooks or configs

---

## v0.4.4 — Test File Discovery

*December 1, 2025*

**Search results now show related test files automatically.**

When `dev_search` returns source files, it checks for matching test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`) and includes them in the response:

```
1. [89%] function: authenticate (src/auth.ts:15)
2. [84%] class: AuthMiddleware (src/middleware.ts:5)

---
Related test files:
  • src/auth.test.ts
  • src/middleware.test.ts
```

This helps AI assistants find both implementation *and* tests without extra searches — useful when fixing bugs or understanding expected behavior.

---

## v0.4.0 — Intelligent Git History

*November 27, 2025*

**Semantic search over your commit history.**

Ever tried to find "when did we add rate limiting?" by scrolling through `git log`? Now you can just ask:

### New Tool: `dev_history`

Search commits by meaning, not just keywords:

```
> "Find commits related to authentication changes"

1. [92%] fix(auth): resolve token refresh race condition
   Author: jane@example.com | 3 days ago
   Files: src/auth/refresh.ts, src/auth/token.ts

2. [87%] feat(auth): add OAuth2 provider support  
   Author: john@example.com | 2 weeks ago
   Files: src/auth/oauth.ts, src/auth/providers/
```

### Change Frequency in `dev_map`

See which parts of your codebase are actively changing:

```
packages/
├── 🔥 core/ (45 components) — 12 commits in 30d
├── ✏️ mcp-server/ (28 components) — 3 commits in 30d
├── 📝 cli/ (15 components) — 2 commits in 90d
└── subagents/ (35 components)
```

- 🔥 **Hot** — 10+ commits in last 30 days
- ✏️ **Active** — 3-9 commits in last 30 days  
- 📝 **Recent** — Any commits in last 90 days

### Context Assembly Improvements

`dev_plan` now includes related commits when assembling context for GitHub issues. AI assistants can see both *what* the issue asks for and *how* similar changes were made before.

---

## v0.3.0 — Code Relationships

*November 26, 2025*

**Understand how your code connects.**

### New Tool: `dev_refs`

Find what calls what — and what's called by what:

```
> "What functions call validateUser?"

Callers of validateUser:
1. AuthMiddleware.authenticate (src/middleware.ts:45)
2. LoginController.handleLogin (src/controllers/login.ts:23)
3. SessionManager.validateSession (src/session.ts:67)
```

Essential for impact analysis before refactoring.

### Hot Paths in `dev_map`

See the most-referenced files in your codebase:

```
Hot Paths (most referenced):
  🔥 src/utils/logger.ts (47 references)
  🔥 src/types/index.ts (34 references)
  🔥 src/config.ts (28 references)
```

### Smarter Context Assembly

`dev_plan` was refactored from generating task breakdowns to assembling rich context. Instead of making assumptions about *how* to implement something, it now gives AI assistants the context they need to figure it out themselves.

---

## v0.1.0 — Initial Release

*November 26, 2025*

**The foundation: local-first code understanding for AI tools.**

### Core Features

- **Semantic Search** — Find code by meaning, not keywords
- **MCP Integration** — Works with Cursor, Claude Code, and any MCP client
- **Multi-language** — TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Python, Rust, Markdown
- **100% Local** — No cloud, no telemetry, all processing on your machine

### Five Tools at Launch

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dev_search` | Semantic code search |
| `dev_plan` | Context assembly for issues |
| `dev_explore` | Pattern discovery |
| `dev_gh` | GitHub issue/PR search |
| `dev_status` | Repository health |

### Installation

One command to index, one command to install:

```bash
npm install -g dev-agent
dev index .
dev mcp install --cursor
```

---

## What's Next?

We're working on:

- **Python support** — Using tree-sitter infrastructure from Go scanner
- **Rust support** — Structs, traits, impl blocks
- **Parallel search** — Query multiple repos simultaneously
