# dev_map

Get a high-level overview of your codebase structure.

## Overview

`dev_map` generates a hierarchical view of your repository showing:
- Directory structure with component counts
- **Hot Paths** — Most referenced files in the codebase
- **Change Frequency** — Which directories are actively changing (v0.4+)
- **Exports** — Public API with function signatures
- **Smart Depth** — Adaptive expansion based on density

This helps AI assistants quickly understand codebase organization and activity.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `depth` | number | `2` | Maximum depth (1-5) |
| `focus` | string | `""` | Focus on specific directory |
| `includeExports` | boolean | `true` | Show exported symbols |
| `includeHotPaths` | boolean | `true` | Show most referenced files |
| `includeChangeFrequency` | boolean | `false` | Show change frequency indicators ✨ v0.4 |
| `smartDepth` | boolean | `false` | Adaptive depth based on density |
| `tokenBudget` | number | `2000` | Max tokens for output |

## Example Output

### With Change Frequency (v0.4+)

```markdown
# Codebase Map

## Hot Paths (most referenced)
1. `packages/core/src/indexer/index.ts` (RepositoryIndexer) - 47 refs
2. `packages/core/src/vector/store.ts` (LanceDBVectorStore) - 32 refs
3. `packages/mcp-server/src/server/mcp-server.ts` (MCPServer) - 28 refs

## Directory Structure

└── packages/ (195 components)
    ├── 🔥 core/ (45 components) — 12 commits in 30d
    │   ├── src/ (42 components)
    │   │   └── exports: function search(query): Promise<Result[]>, class RepositoryIndexer
    │   └── dist/
    ├── ✏️ mcp-server/ (28 components) — 3 commits in 30d
    │   └── exports: class MCPServer, class SearchAdapter
    ├── 📝 cli/ (15 components) — 2 commits in 90d
    └── subagents/ (35 components)

**Total:** 195 indexed components across 24 directories
```

### Change Frequency Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 🔥 | **Hot** — 5+ commits in the last 30 days |
| ✏️ | **Active** — 1-4 commits in the last 30 days |
| 📝 | **Recent** — Commits in the last 90 days |
| (none) | No recent changes |

## Features

### Hot Paths

Shows the most referenced files in your codebase. These are typically:
- Core utilities used everywhere
- Base classes/interfaces
- Central orchestrators

Useful for understanding which code is most critical.

### Change Frequency ✨ v0.4

Shows which directories are actively being modified:

```json
{
  "includeChangeFrequency": true
}
```

This helps AI assistants:
- Identify areas under active development
- Avoid conflicts with ongoing work
- Understand project focus areas

### Smart Depth

When enabled, expands directories with many components and collapses sparse ones:

```json
{
  "smartDepth": true,
  "smartDepthThreshold": 10
}
```

- Directories with ≥10 components get expanded
- Sparse directories get collapsed
- First 2 levels always shown

### Focus Directory

Zoom into a specific part of the codebase:

```json
{
  "focus": "packages/core/src",
  "depth": 4
}
```

### Signatures in Exports

Exports show function/class signatures (truncated to 60 chars):

```
└── exports: function search(query, opts): Promise<Result[]>, class Indexer
```

## Use Cases

### Onboarding

```
Show me the overall structure of this codebase
```

### Finding Entry Points

```
What are the main components in packages/mcp-server?
```

### Understanding Architecture

```
Show the codebase map with hot paths to understand the core modules
```

### Scoping Work

```
Focus on packages/core/src with depth 4 to see all scanner components
```

## Tips

- Start with default depth (2) for overview
- Use `focus` to drill into specific areas
- Enable `smartDepth` for large codebases
- Hot paths reveal the most important code
- Signatures help understand APIs without reading files
