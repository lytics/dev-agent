# Introduction

**dev-agent** provides semantic code search to AI assistants like Cursor and Claude Code via MCP.

We built this for ourselves. When exploring large codebases, we found AI tools spending too much time grepping through files. dev-agent gives them a faster path: search by meaning, not keywords.

## What it does

1. **Indexes your codebase** locally with embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
2. **Exposes 9 MCP tools** for semantic search, code relationships, git history
3. **Integrates with GitHub** to search issues and PRs semantically

## Measured impact

We benchmarked dev-agent against baseline Claude Code:

| Metric | Baseline | With dev-agent | Change |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------|
| Cost | $1.82 | $1.02 | **-44%** |
| Time | 14.1 min | 11.5 min | **-19%** |
| Tool calls | 69 | 40 | **-42%** |

**Trade-off:** Faster but sometimes less thorough. Best for implementation tasks and exploration. For deep debugging, baseline Claude may read more files.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic Search** | Find code by meaning, not keywords |
| **Relationship Queries** | What calls this function? What does it call? |
| **Git History** | Semantic search over commits |
| **GitHub Integration** | Search issues and PRs semantically |
| **100% Local** | Your code never leaves your machine |

## Architecture

dev-agent is a monorepo:

- **@lytics/dev-agent-core** — Scanning, vector storage, GitHub integration
- **@lytics/dev-agent-cli** — Command-line interface
- **@lytics/dev-agent-mcp** — MCP server with 9 tool adapters
- **@lytics/dev-agent-subagents** — Planner, explorer agents
