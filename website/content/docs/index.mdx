# Introduction

**dev-agent** is a local-first repository context provider for AI tools. It gives AI assistants like Cursor and Claude Code deep understanding of your codebase through semantic search, code analysis, and GitHub integration.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they struggle with context:

- They can't search your codebase semantically
- They don't understand relationships between files
- They lack awareness of your GitHub issues and PRs
- They hallucinate about code that doesn't exist

## The Solution

dev-agent solves this by:

1. **Indexing your codebase** with local embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
2. **Exposing semantic search** via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
3. **Integrating with GitHub** to understand your project's history
4. **Providing specialized tools** for planning, exploration, and more

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic Search** | Find code by meaning, not keywords |
| **AST Analysis** | Type-aware understanding of your code |
| **GitHub Integration** | Search issues and PRs semantically |
| **Local-First** | Your code never leaves your machine |
| **MCP Native** | Works with Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code |

## Architecture Overview

dev-agent is built as a monorepo with specialized packages:

- **@lytics/dev-agent-core** — Repository scanning, vector storage, GitHub integration
- **@lytics/dev-agent-cli** — Command-line interface
- **@lytics/dev-agent-mcp** — MCP server with tool adapters
- **@lytics/dev-agent-subagents** — Specialized agents (planner, explorer, PR manager)
